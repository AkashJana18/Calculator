# Calculator
This code is a basic implementation of a calculator web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML is used to create the structure of the calculator, with buttons for numbers, operators, and functions like clear and backspace. CSS is used for styling, including a dark theme toggle button, and JavaScript is used to handle button clicks and perform calculations.

The code sets up event listeners for button clicks and defines behavior for each button based on its id. For example, clicking the clear button clears the display, clicking a number button appends that number to the display, and clicking the equal button evaluates the expression displayed using the JavaScript eval() function.

The code also includes functionality for toggling the calculator between a light and dark theme.
